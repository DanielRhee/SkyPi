# Parameters in capture.py
The 3 important parameters are exposureTime, analogueGain, and digitalGain.
A more comprehensive description of what each parameter does is available in the PiCamera documentation or the Handbook of Astronomical Image Processing.
Exposure time is how long the sensor is physically capturing light.
Analogue gain is hardware amplification of the signal.
Digital gain is amplification at the signal processor level.

The other parameters available are focus which defines the physical focus position, and sharpness which defines the hardness of the hardware.
